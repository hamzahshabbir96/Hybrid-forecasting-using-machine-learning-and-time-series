This project is a model to combine the Machine learning model with the Time series model for hybrid forecasting of Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI). This hybrid model exploits the performance of the Time series model and Machine learning model, which per-form differently on a different set of weather conditions, to give a more accurate result. For this research, Random Forest has been used as a machine learning model, and for the Time series model, Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with exogenous regressors (SARI-MAX) model has been used. The machine learning model considers weather conditions such as humidity, cloud cover temp, etc., to predict GHI, and the time series model only depends on past values of data which makes it independent of weather conditions. Sometimes, due to the rapid fluctuation of weather conditions, the time series model might give a less accurate result than the machine learning model. Similarly, GHI forecasting with a machine learning model gives less ac-curate results with less accurate weather forecast data. A hybrid forecast tends to exploit the ad-vantages of both models and overcome limitations. The final forecast from the Hybrid model con-tains the weightage of each model, which is calculated during the validation period using a re-gression algorithm.
